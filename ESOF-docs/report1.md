##Brief description of the project
Eclipse Color Theme makes it possible to import and switch color themes conveniently and without side effects.

While Eclipse allows you to change the syntax coloring in great detail, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. 
It is possible to achieve that by importing and exporting preferences files, but this is inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences. Furthermore, color themes have to be created for every single editor, a theme for the Java editor does not change the XML, JavaScript or any other editors. This plugin solves these issues by mapping a generic color theme format to specific preferences entries for each supported editor.

##Development Process - Alternatives
Best Software Process for this project: 

* Prototyping. Reasons: 
    - Prototyping is not a standalone, complete development methodology, but rather an approach to try out particular features in the context of a full methodology (such as incremental, spiral, or rapid application development (RAD)).
    - Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
    - The user is involved throughout the development process, which increases the likelihood of user acceptance of the final implementation.
    
* Rapid application development. Reasons: 
    - Key objective is for fast development and delivery of a high quality system at a relatively low investment cost.
    - Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.

##Development Process
We couldn't contact the developers, but by analysing the commits made thorough the growth of the application, we were able to approximate the development process used by those who initially started this endeavour.
Our group came to the conclusion that the aforementioned process adopted was Iterative and Incremental Development which can be succinctly described as small changes to the code, which are then tested, and if workable, commited to the main project. 
After analysing this process, among all that were studied, we found it to be the one that best fit the commits in Eclipse Color Theme. 


###Contributing

There are multiple ways to contribute to the development of the plugin, namely, creating an editor mapping, creating a theme and you can contribute to code too.
 *Creating an editor mapping:
	Create a new mapping for any new editor, this does not require programming and is fairly easy to contribute, you just need to do some research.
 *Creating a theme:
	Create a custom theme for any editor supported by the plugin.
 *Contributing to the code:
	Contribute to the code in a positive way, you can correct bugs or add new features.

You don't need a lot of experience to contribute, creating an editor mapping or creating a theme is accessible to anyone who wants to contribute. There is an [**contributor guide**](https://github.com/eclipse-color-theme/eclipse-color-theme/wiki/Contributing) that explains how to get started on working in this project.

To help with the code you first need to open an issue before starting to work.
