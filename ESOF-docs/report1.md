(Brief description of the project)
Eclipse Color Theme makes it possible to import and switch color themes conveniently and without side effects.

While Eclipse allows you to change the syntax coloring in great detail, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. 
It is possible to achieve that by importing and exporting preferences files, but this is inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences. Furthermore, color themes have to be created for every single editor, a theme for the Java editor does not change the XML, JavaScript or any other editors. This plugin solves these issues by mapping a generic color theme format to specific preferences entries for each supported editor.

(Development Process - Alternatives)
Best Software Process for this project: 

* Prototyping. Reasons: 
    - Prototyping is not a standalone, complete development methodology, but rather an approach to try out particular features in the context of a full methodology (such as incremental, spiral, or rapid application development (RAD)).
    - Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
    - The user is involved throughout the development process, which increases the likelihood of user acceptance of the final implementation.
    
* Rapid application development. Reasons: 
    - Key objective is for fast development and delivery of a high quality system at a relatively low investment cost.
    - Attempts to reduce inherent project risk by breaking a project into smaller segments and providing more ease-of-change during the development process.
