Eclipse Color Theme makes it possible to import and switch color themes conveniently and without side effects.

While Eclipse allows you to change the syntax coloring in great detail, there is no support for managing multiple color themes. 
It is possible to achieve that by importing and exporting preferences files, but this is inconvenient and likely to mess up your preferences. Furthermore, color themes have to be created for every single editor, a theme for the Java editor does not change the XML, JavaScript or any other editors. This plugin solves these issues by mapping a generic color theme format to specific preferences entries for each supported editor.
