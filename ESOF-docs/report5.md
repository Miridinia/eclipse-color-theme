##Introduction

This report aims to describe the development of a new feature, exposing it's development process from it's identification, the identification of the components that implement the feature, and the submission by a pull request of the feature.

##Identification of a feature

Eclipse Color Theme has issues in its github repository that represent hints of features to implement and some bugs that have been detected throughout the development process. In addition to this repository, Eclipse Color Theme has a website that allows us to develop new themes to add to the project. It was in the repository issues that we found a feature that we found accessible in terms of complexity, given the time available, and quite opportune.
The issue we chose was//TODO

##Identifying components that implement the feature




The goal of this last assignment is to evolve a feature in the selected project and document how the process taken to evolve the feature (that is, document the change impact analysis and feature evolution)

In particular, this report should discuss the following

Discuss Software Maintainability using the SIG metrics (plus add the badge to your .md file). Students should contact the recitations professor in order to be added to the ESOF organization to be able to automatically compute the metrics of interest using the service https://bettercodehub.com/. See the pdf with an example of a report of the interesting metrics and a description of what they represent.
